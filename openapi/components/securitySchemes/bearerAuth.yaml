description: |
  A JWT generated for a particular app or user.

  This token allows the bearer to perform requests within the context of the
  app/user for whom the token was generated. The JWT tokens have different scopes
  to limit what endpoints can be used; it is recommended that only the strictly required 
  scopes are allocated to an API app or user.
